オープンソースの依存関係に**セキュリティ脆弱性**がないことを確認することは、現代のソフトウェア開発において不可欠なステップです。Snyk MCP Server と Google Code Assist を組み合わせることで、**AI アシスト**による脆弱性スキャンを開発環境内で**迅速**に実行できるようになりました。

[Snyk のドキュメントへ](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/snyk-studio-agentic-integrations)

### 🧰 前提条件

開始する前に、以下の準備が必要です。

- **VS Code**がインストールされていること
- Google Code Assist および Snyk で使用する**Google アカウント**

---

### ⚙️ セットアップ手順

#### 1. VSCode に Google Code Assist をインストール

VS Code Marketplace を開き、[Google Code Assist 拡張機能](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Google.geminicodeassist)を検索するか、VSCode の拡張機能アイコンをクリックして Google Code Assist を検索します。
**インストール**をクリックし、セットアップが完了したらエディタを再読み込みします。

#### 2. 設定ファイルを追加

リポジトリ内に、以下の設定ファイルを作成します。

```shell
mkdir .gemini
touch .gemini/settings.json
```

`settings.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Snyk": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "snyk@latest", "mcp", "-t", "stdio"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

このファイルは、Google Code Assist がプロジェクトのコンテキストや Snyk MCP Server などの**外部ツールと連携**するために役立ちます。

#### 3. 脆弱性スキャンを実行

VSCode で Google Code Assist パネルを開き、以下のプロンプトを入力します。

```
Tell me about any vulnerabilities found in my open source dependencies for this project
（このプロジェクトのオープンソース依存関係で見つかった脆弱性について教えてください）
```

その後、Snyk MCP サーバーの使用を**承認**する必要があります。

`https://github.com/forem/forem` で同じプロンプトを試した**結果**は以下の通りです。

#### 結果

I can also open a Snyk learn lesson for some of these vulnerabilities. Would you like me to open a lesson for any of the vulnerabilities?
